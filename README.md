# Installation

## Download Source ##

Download the source from github, which can be achieved via the following in a
terminal, which will create an *isofinder* directory in your current directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/sean-dougherty/isofinder.git
```

## Build Version 1 ##

Move to the *isofinder/version1* directory:

```
cd isofinder/version1
```

Execute the Makefile:

```
make
```

You should now have an *isofinder* binary in your current directory, which
can be invoked with no arguments for usage information:

```
./isofinder
```
